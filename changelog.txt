Fairy's Overhaul, v 0.8 Changelog

Main:
- Incorporated my Terrain Overhaul Mod, as I lack Advance Wars-style sprites for most new Terrains
- Altered some sprites, such as the Terrain Defense Star and CO Bar
- Did some bugfixes

Terrain:
- Added Marshes, Farmlands, Railways, Railbridges, Railroad Crossings and Open Sky
- Overhauled movement costs for most movetypes

Units:
- Motorized and Amphibious Infantry no longer Resupply Units or transport Field Guns
- IFVs are now renamed Armoured Infantry (Amphibious Armoured Infantry and Heavy Armoured Infantry respectively)
- All Infantry-Type Units now have 1 cargo slot for Foot Infantry
- Increased the Price for Ekranoplans to try and make them less of a spam unit

New Units:
- Added Mechanized Infantry, they're as strong as Motorized Infantry but move around on Treads
- Added Foot Infantry. This unit is not available in Skirmish, and exists purely for campaign/mission makers. They're slow and weak
- Added All-Terrain Infantry and Screw Vehicles. These units struggle on plains and roads but excel in swamps, snow and rivers
- Added Fast and Heavy Trains. Fast Trains are faster than their Heavy counterparts, but carry 2 ground units instead of 3
- Added Armoured Trains. Armoured Trains can pack a punch to anything next to or on rails
- Added Railway Guns. These are slow and squishy but have a tremendous range
- Added Supply Trains. These unarmed trains can resupply all ground units in the 8 tiles around them
- Added Supply Trucks and Supply Ships. These unarmed units can resupply land and naval units respectively
- Added Coastal Patrol Ships and Seamines. Coastal Patrol Ships are armed with Light naval guns and can drop 2 Seamines. Seamines detonate at the start of their owner's turn if an enemy ship is adjacent to them, and hurt the enemy with the most HP for 4 HP
- Added the Orlyonok, a lighter Ekranoplan that is cheaper but carries no weapons
- Added the ARV, a special transport vehicle that can pick up armoured vehicles from adjacent tiles without having to move
- Added the AVLB, a single-use unit that deploys a bridge on a river, but is expended in the process
- Added the Dozer, a light unit capable of build Temporary Airports and Temporary Ports
- Added the Cash Truck/Train/Plane/Boat. These units are capable of transferring funds to allies
- Added the Mech, a new lab unit that is as strong as a Tank but can traverse more terrain
- Added the OGRE, a behemoth of a Cybertank that can defeat most other units and crush land units under its massive threads
