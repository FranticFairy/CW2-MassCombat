# CW2-MassCombat
Previously simply known as Fairy's Overhaul Mod for Commander Wars 2 (https://github.com/Robosturm/Commander_Wars/), I have since renamed this to Mass Combat.

I take NO credit for the unit/terrain background sprites! They are from Switchcars (https://store.steampowered.com/app/442210/Switchcars/) and are used because I like them and lack other sprites that fit my needs. 

To get the latest version of this mod, simply download this as a Zip, create a folder for the mod in your mods folder, then drop the contents of the zip into that folder.
